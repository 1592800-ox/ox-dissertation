  abstract = {Base editing — the introduction of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) into DNA or RNA in living cells — is one of the most recent advances in the field of genome editing. As around half of known pathogenic genetic variants are due to SNVs, base editing holds great potential for the treatment of numerous genetic diseases, through either temporary RNA or permanent DNA base alterations. Recent advances in the specificity, efficiency, precision and delivery of DNA and RNA base editors are revealing exciting therapeutic opportunities for these technologies. We expect the correction of single point mutations will be a major focus of future precision medicine.},

We characterized sequence-activity relationships of 11 cytosine and adenine base editors (CBEs and ABEs) on 38,538 genomically integrated targets in mammalian cells and used the resulting outcomes to train BE-Hive, a machine learning model that accurately predicts base editing genotypic outcomes (R z 0.9) and efficiency (R z 0.7). We corrected 3,388 disease-associated SNVs with R90\% precision, including 675 alleles with bystander nucleotides that BE-Hive correctly predicted would not be edited. We discovered determinants of previously unpredictable C-to-G, or C-to-A editing and used these discoveries to correct coding sequences of 174 pathogenic transversion SNVs with R90\% precision. Finally, we used insights from BE-Hive to engineer novel CBE variants that modulate editing outcomes. These discoveries illuminate base editing, enable editing at previously intractable targets, and provide new base editors with improved editing capabilities.},

  abstract = {CRISPR/Cas base editors promise nucleotide-level control over DNA sequences, but the determinants of their activity remain incompletely understood. We measured base editing frequencies in two human cell lines for two cytosine and two adenine base editors at ∼14 000 target sequences and find that base editing activity is sequence-biased, with largest effects from nucleotides flanking the target base. Whether a base is edited depends strongly on the combination of its position in the target and the preceding base, acting to widen or narrow the effective editing window. The impact of features on editing rate depends on the position, with sequence bias efficacy mainly influencing bases away from the center of the window. We use these observations to train a machine learning model to predict editing activity per position, with accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.72 between editors, and with better generalization across datasets than existing tools. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model by predicting the efficacy of disease mutation correcting guides, and find that most of them suffer from more unwanted editing than pure outcomes. This work unravels the position-specificity of base editing biases and allows more efficient planning of editing campaigns in experimental and therapeutic contexts.},

We design a library of 3,604 sequences of various lengths and measure the frequency of their insertion into four genomic sites in three human cell lines, using different prime editor systems in varying DNA repair contexts. We find that length, nucleotide composition and secondary structure of the insertion sequence all affect insertion rates. We also discover that the 3′ flap nucleases TREX1 and TREX2 suppress the insertion of longer sequences. Combining the sequence and repair features into a machine learning model, we can predict relative frequency of insertions into a site with               R               \,=\,0.70.

Base-editing, the newest evolution of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas-based technologies, can directly install point-mutations in cellular DNA without inducing a double-strand DNA break (DSB). Two classes of DNA base-editors have been described thus far, cytosine base-editors (CBEs) and adenine base-editors (ABEs). Recently, prime-editing (PE) has further expanded the CRISPR-base-edit toolkit to all twelve possible transition and transversion mutations, as well as small insertion or deletion mutations. Safe and efficient delivery of editing systems to target cells is one of the most paramount and challenging components for the therapeutic success of BEs. Due to its broad tropism, well-studied serotypes, and reduced immunogenicity, adeno-associated vector (AAV) has emerged as the leading platform for viral delivery of genome editing agents, including DNA-base-editors. In this review, we describe the development of various base-editors, assess their technical advantages and limitations, and discuss their therapeutic potential to treat debilitating human diseases.},

We developed PE4 and PE5 prime editing systems in which transient expression of an engineered MMR-inhibiting protein enhances the efficiency of substitution, small insertion, and small deletion prime edits by an average 7.7-fold and 2.0-fold compared to PE2 and PE3 systems, respectively, while improving edit/indel ratios by 3.4-fold in MMR-proficient cell types.

Prime editor protein optimization resulted in a PEmax architecture that enhances editing efficacy by 2.8-fold on average in HeLa cells.

However, nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), an error-prone repair, acts concurrently, reducing the rate of high-fidelity edits. The identification of genome-editing conditions that favor HDR over NHEJ has been hindered by the lack of a simple method to measure HDR and NHEJ directly and simultaneously at endogenous loci. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel, rapid, digital PCR–based assay that can simultaneously detect one HDR or NHEJ event out of 1,000 copies of the genome. Using this assay, we systematically monitored genome-editing outcomes of CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), Cas9 nickases, catalytically dead Cas9 fused to FokI, and transcription activator–like effector nuclease at three disease-associated endogenous gene loci in HEK293T cells, HeLa cells, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Although it is widely thought that NHEJ generally occurs more often than HDR, we found that more HDR than NHEJ was induced under multiple conditions. Surprisingly, the HDR/NHEJ ratios were highly dependent on gene locus, nuclease platform, and cell type. The new assay system, and our findings based on it, will enable mechanistic studies of genome-editing and help improve genome-editing technology.},

  abstract = {Mammalian non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) is the primary pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) throughout the cell cycle, including during S and G2 phases.NHEJ relies on the Ku protein to thread onto each broken DNA end. Ku recruits the enzymes and complexes that are needed to trim (nucleases) or to fill in (polymerases) the ends to make them optimally ligatable by the DNA ligase IV complex.The configuration of the DNA ends determines which of several subpathways of NHEJ is able to join the ends. Because NHEJ is flexible and iterative, any of these subpathways can be used but some pathways are more efficient than others for certain DNA ends.When NHEJ is absent owing to a lack of Ku or the DNA ligase complex, alternative end joining (a-EJ) can join the ends using microhomology (usually {$>$}4 bp) and there is often some evidence of templated insertions of substantial length ({$>$}10 nucleotides). DNA polymerase θ (Pol θ) is of key importance for a-EJ.The single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway requires further end resection by exonuclease 1 (EXO1), Bloom syndrome RecQ-like helicase (BLM) or DNA replication helicase/nuclease 2 (DNA2) to generate the long 3′ single-strand DNA (ssDNA) tails ({$>$}20 nucleotides) that are bound by replication protein A (RPA) to prevent the formation of DNA secondary structures. The 3′ ssDNA tails are annealed by RAD52.},

  abstract = {RNA-guided programmable nucleases from CRISPR systems generate precise breaks in DNA or RNA at specified positions. In cells, this activity can lead to changes in DNA sequence or RNA transcript abundance. Base editing is a newer genome editing approach that uses components from CRISPR systems together with other enzymes to directly install point mutations into cellular DNA or RNA without making double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). DNA base editors comprise a catalytically disabled nuclease fused to a nucleobase deaminase enzyme and, in some cases, a DNA glycosylase inhibitor. RNA base editors achieve analogous changes using components that target RNA. Base editors directly convert one base or base pair into another, enabling the efficient installation of point mutations in non-dividing cells without generating excess undesired editing byproducts. In this Review, we summarize base editing strategies to generate specific and precise point mutations in genomic DNA and RNA, highlight recent developments that expand the scope, specificity, precision, and in vivo delivery of base editors, and discuss limitations and future directions of base editing for research and therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Prime editing technology is capable of generating targeted insertions, deletions, and base conversions. However, the process of designing prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs), which contain a primer binding site and a reverse-transcription template at the 3′ end, is more complex than that for the single guide RNAs used with CRISPR nucleases or base editors. Furthermore, the assessment of high-throughput sequencing data after prime editors (PEs) have been employed should consider the unique feature of PEs; thus, pre-existing assessment tools cannot directly be adopted for PEs. Here, we present two user-friendly web-based tools for PEs, named PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer. PE-Designer, a dedicated tool for pegRNA selection, provides all possible target sequences, pegRNA extension sequences, and nicking guide RNA sequences together with useful information, and displays the results in an interactive image. PE-Analyzer, a dedicated tool for PE outcome analysis, accepts high-throughput sequencing data, summarizes mutation-related information in a table, and provides interactive graphs. PE-Analyzer was mainly written using JavaScript so that it can analyze several data sets without requiring that huge sequencing data (\&gt;100MB) be uploaded to the server, reducing analysis time and increasing personal security. PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer are freely available at http://www.rgenome.net/pe-designer/ and http://www.rgenome.net/pe-analyzer/ without a login process.},

  abstract = {Prime editing enables the introduction of virtually any small-sized genetic change without requiring donor DNA or double-strand breaks. However, evaluation of prime editing efficiency requires time-consuming experiments, and the factors that affect efficiency have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we performed high-throughput evaluation of prime editor 2 (PE2) activities in human cells using 54,836 pairs of prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) and their target sequences. The resulting data sets allowed us to identify factors affecting PE2 efficiency and to develop three computational models to predict pegRNA efficiency. For a given target sequence, the computational models predict efficiencies of pegRNAs with different lengths of primer binding sites and reverse transcriptase templates for edits of various types and positions. Testing the accuracy of the predictions using test data sets that were not used for training, we found Spearman’s correlations between 0.47 and 0.81. Our computational models and information about factors affecting PE2 efficiency will facilitate practical application of prime editing.},

Target recognition strictly requires the presence of a short protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target site, and subsequent R-loop formation and strand scission are driven by complementary base pairing between the guide RNA and target DNA, Cas9–DNA interactions, and associated conformational changes. The use of CRISPR–Cas9 as an RNA-programmable DNA targeting and editing platform is simplified by a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) mimicking the natural dual trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA)–CRISPR RNA (crRNA) structure. This review aims to provide an in-depth mechanistic and structural understanding of Cas9-mediated RNA-guided DNA targeting and cleavage. Molecular insights from biochemical and structural studies provide a framework for rational engineering aimed at altering catalytic function, guide RNA specificity, and PAM requirements and reducing off-target activity for the development of Cas9-based therapies against genetic diseases.},

Although of epithelial origin, its biochemical machinery is capable of carrying out most of the post-translational folding and processing required to generate functional, mature protein from a wide spectrum of both mammalian and non-mammalian nucleic acids. Though popular as a transient expression system, this cell type has also seen wide use in stably transfected forms (i.e. transformed cells) to study a variety of cell-biological questions in neurobiology. The principal attributes which have made the HEK cell a popular choice among electrophysiologists to study isolated receptor channels include; its quick and easy reproduction and maintenance; amenability to transfection using a wide variety of methods; high efficiency of transfection and protein production; faithful translation and processing of proteins; and small cell size with minimal processes appropriate for voltage-clamp experimentation. These, and other attributes, also mean that complementary biochemical/cell biological evaluations of expressed proteins can be performed in concert with functional analyses to establish detailed pharmacological and biophysical profiles for the action of new drugs and their targets. The increased amount of sequence information available from the human genome has placed greater emphasis upon heterologous cell expression systems as targets for high throughput structure–function evaluation of novel drug targets and disease markers. Here we have highlighted some of the innate characteristics of the HEK cell in order that its suitability as a vehicle for the expression of a gene product can be assessed for particular needs. We have also detailed some of the standard methods used for transfection and obtaining functional data from electrophysiological recording techniques.},

  abstract = {In only a few years, as a breakthrough technology, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) gene-editing systems have ushered in the era of genome engineering with a plethora of applications. One of the most promising CRISPR tools, so-called base editors, opened an exciting avenue for exploring new therapeutic approaches through controlled mutagenesis. However, the efficiency of a base editor guide varies depending on several biological determinants, such as chromatin accessibility, DNA repair proteins, transcriptional activity, factors related to local sequence context and so on. Thus, the success of genetic perturbation directed by CRISPR/Cas base-editing systems relies on an optimal single guide RNA (sgRNA) design, taking those determinants into account. Although there is 11 commonly used software to design guides specifically for base editors, only three of them investigated and implemented those biological determinants into their models. This review presents the key features, capabilities and limitations of all currently available software with a particular focus on predictive model-based algorithms. Here, we summarize existing software for sgRNA design and provide a base for improving the efficiency of existing available software suites for precise target base editing.},

The organization of accessible chromatin across the genome reflects a network of permissible physical interactions through which enhancers, promoters, insulators and chromatin-binding factors cooperatively regulate gene expression. This landscape of accessibility changes dynamically in response to both external stimuli and developmental cues, and emerging evidence suggests that homeostatic maintenance of accessibility is itself dynamically regulated through a competitive interplay between chromatin-binding factors and nucleosomes. In this Review, we examine how the accessible genome is measured and explore the role of transcription factors in initiating accessibility remodelling; our goal is to illustrate how chromatin accessibility defines regulatory elements within the genome and how these epigenetic features are dynamically established to control gene expression.},

Among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci together with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR/Cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of DNA called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. It was recently demonstrated that these variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. Here we show that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. Acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. We also provide in vivo evidence that the CRISPR1/Cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded DNA within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. Our data show that the CRISPR/Cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading DNA rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.},

Over the years biological therapy evolved from using stem cells and viral vectors to RNA therapy and testing different genome editing tools as promising gene therapy agents. These genome editing technologies (Zinc finger nucleases, TAL effector nucleases), specifically CRISPR-Cas system, revolutionized the field of genetic engineering and is widely applied to create cell and animal models for various hereditary, infectious human diseases and cancer, to analyze and understand the molecular and cellular base of pathogenesis, to find potential drug/treatment targets, to eliminate pathogenic DNA changes in various medical conditions and to create future “precise medication”. Although different concerning factors, such as precise system delivery to the target cells, efficacy and accuracy of editing process, different approaches of making the DNA changes as well as worrying bioethical issues remain, the importance of genome editing technologies in medicine is undeniable. The future of innovative genome editing approach and strategies to treat diseases is complicated but interesting and exciting at once for all related parties – researchers, clinicians, and patients.},

  abstract = {The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of transitions from C•G to T•A base pairs, which account for half of known pathogenic point mutations in humans. The ability to efficiently convert targeted A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. The deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, but no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we describe adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate the conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a transfer RNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR–Cas9 mutant. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs that convert targeted A•T base pairs efficiently to G•C (approximately 50\% efficiency in human cells) with high product purity (typically at least 99.9\%) and low rates of indels (typically no more than 0.1\%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly, and with less off-target genome modification, than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with previous base editors, ABEs enable the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.},

Using Repair-seq, we profiled DSB repair products induced by two programmable nucleases (Cas9 and Cas12a) in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides for homology-directed repair (HDR) after knockdown of 476 genes involved in DSB repair or associated processes. The resulting data enabled principled, data-driven inference of DSB end joining and HDR pathways. Systematic interrogation of this data uncovered unexpected relationships among DSB repair genes and demonstrated that repair outcomes with superficially similar sequence architectures can have markedly different genetic dependencies.

  abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers’ computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5× higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

We incorporated structured RNA motifs to the 3' terminus of pegRNAs that enhance their stability and prevent degradation of the 3' extension. The resulting engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs) improve prime editing efficiency 3-4-fold in HeLa, U2OS and K562 cells and in primary human fibroblasts without increasing off-target editing activity. We optimized the choice of 3' structural motif and developed pegLIT, a computational tool to identify non-interfering nucleotide linkers between pegRNAs and 3' motifs.

Simple indices, obtained by dividing the MFE by the number of nucleotides, have been used for a direct comparison of the folding stability of RNAs of various sizes. Although this normalization procedure has been used in several studies, the relationship between normalized MFE and length has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we demonstrate that the variation of MFE with sequence length is not linear and is significantly biased by the mathematical formula used for the normalization procedure. For this reason, the normalized MFEs strongly decrease as hyperbolic functions of length and produce unreliable results when applied for the comparison of sequences with different sizes. We also propose a simple modification of the normalization formula that corrects the bias enabling the use of the normalized MFE for RNAs longer than 40 nt. Using the new corrected normalized index, we analyzed the folding free energies of different human RNA families showing that most of them present an average MFE density more negative than expected for a typical genomic sequence. Furthermore, we found that a well-defined and restricted range of MFE density characterizes each RNA family, suggesting the use of our corrected normalized index to improve RNA prediction algorithms. Finally, in coding and functional human RNAs the MFE density appears scarcely correlated with sequence length, consistent with a negligible role of thermodynamic stability demands in determining RNA size.},

Here, we show that the extensive structure of Pol III-synthesized transcripts dictates the release of elongation complexes at the end of genes. The poly-T termination signal, which does not cause termination in itself, causes catalytic inactivation and backtracking of Pol III, thus committing the enzyme to termination and transporting it to the nearest RNA secondary structure, which facilitates Pol III release. Similarity between termination mechanisms of Pol III and bacterial RNA polymerase suggests that hairpin-dependent termination may date back to the common ancestor of multisubunit RNA polymerases.},

  abstract = {RNA polymerase is a ratchet machine that oscillates between productive and backtracked states at numerous DNA positions. The amount of backtracking (reversible sliding of the enzyme along DNA and RNA) varies from one to many nucleotides. Since its first description 15 years ago, backtracking has been implicated in a plethora of critical processes in bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Here we review the most fundamental roles of this phenomenon in controlling transcription elongation, pausing, termination, fidelity, and genome instability. We also discuss recent progress in understanding the structural and mechanistic properties of the backtracking process.},

  abstract = {Deciphering individual cell phenotypes from cell-specific transcriptional processes requires high dimensional single cell RNA sequencing. However, current dimensionality reduction methods aggregate sparse gene information across cells, without directly measuring the relationships that exist between genes. By performing dimensionality reduction with respect to gene co-expression, low-dimensional features can model these gene-specific relationships and leverage shared signal to overcome sparsity. We describe GeneVector, a scalable framework for dimensionality reduction implemented as a vector space model using mutual information between gene expression. Unlike other methods, including principal component analysis and variational autoencoders, GeneVector uses latent space arithmetic in a lower dimensional gene embedding to identify transcriptional programs and classify cell types. In this work, we show in four single cell RNA-seq datasets that GeneVector was able to capture phenotype-specific pathways, perform batch effect correction, interactively annotate cell types, and identify pathway variation with treatment over time.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have enabled progress in a wide variety of applications. Growing the size of the neural network typically results in improved accuracy. As model sizes grow, the memory and compute requirements for training these models also increases. We introduce a technique to train deep neural networks using half precision floating point numbers. In our technique, weights, activations and gradients are stored in IEEE half-precision format. Half-precision floating numbers have limited numerical range compared to single-precision numbers. We propose two techniques to handle this loss of information. Firstly, we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of the weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step. This single-precision copy is rounded to half-precision format during training. Secondly, we propose scaling the loss appropriately to handle the loss of information with half-precision gradients. We demonstrate that this approach works for a wide variety of models including convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. This technique works for large scale models with more than 100 million parameters trained on large datasets. Using this approach, we can reduce the memory consumption of deep learning models by nearly 2x. In future processors, we can also expect a significant computation speedup using half-precision hardware units.},

However, these methods require a large amount of labeled ground truth data that is often unavailable. To address this limitation, we present a weighted average ensemble model that can automatically segment biological structures in electron microscopy images when trained with only a small dataset. Thus, we exploit the fact that a combination of diverse base-learners is able to outperform one single segmentation model. Our experiments with seven different biological electron microscopy datasets demonstrate quantitative and qualitative improvements. We show that the Grad-CAM method can be used to interpret and verify the prediction of our model. Compared with a standard U-Net, the performance of our method is superior for all tested datasets. Furthermore, our model leverages a limited number of labeled training data to segment the electron microscopy images and therefore has a high potential for automated biological applications.},

  abstract = {Brain tumor diagnosis at an early stage can improve the chances of successful treatment and better patient outcomes. In the biomedical industry, non-invasive diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used to diagnose brain tumors. Deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence, can analyze MRI images in a matter of seconds, reducing the time it takes for diagnosis and potentially improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, an ensemble model can help increase the accuracy of classification by combining the strengths of multiple models and compensating for their individual weaknesses. Therefore, in this research, a weighted average ensemble deep learning model is proposed for the classification of brain tumors. For the weighted ensemble classification model, three different feature spaces are taken from the transfer learning VGG19 model, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model without augmentation, and CNN model with augmentation. These three feature spaces are ensembled with the best combination of weights, i.e., weight1, weight2, and weight3 by using grid search. The dataset used for simulation is taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), having a lower-grade glioma collection with 3929 MRI images of 110 patients. The ensemble model helps reduce overfitting by combining multiple models that have learned different aspects of the data. The proposed ensemble model outperforms the three individual models for detecting brain tumors in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Therefore, the proposed model can act as a second opinion tool for radiologists to diagnose the tumor from MRI images of the brain.},

This paper addresses a related regression problem: the prediction of rare extreme values of a continuous variable. These values are often regarded as outliers and removed from posterior analysis. However, for many applications (e.g. in finance, meteorology, biology, etc.) these are the key values that we want to accurately predict. Any learning method obtains models by optimizing some preference criteria. In this paper we propose new evaluation criteria that are more adequate for these applications. We describe a generalization for regression of the concepts of precision and recall often used in classification. Using these new evaluation metrics we are able to focus the evaluation of predictive models on the cases that really matter for these applications. Our experiments indicate the advantages of the use of these new measures when comparing predictive models in the context of our target applications.},

  abstract = {Several real world prediction problems involve forecasting rare values of a target variable. When this variable is nominal, we have a problem of class imbalance that was thoroughly studied within machine learning. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works exist addressing this type of problem. Still, important applications involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable. This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks. Namely, we propose to address such tasks by resampling approaches that change the distribution of the given data set to decrease the problem of imbalance between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones. We present two modifications of well-known resampling strategies for classification tasks: the under-sampling and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) methods. These modifications allow the use of these strategies on regression tasks where the goal is to forecast rare extreme values of the target variable. In an extensive set of experiments, we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our proposals for these particular regression tasks. The proposed resampling methods can be used with any existing regression algorithm, which means that they are general tools for addressing problems of forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.},

Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

  abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

In this context, it becomes an important topic in the data mining field that how to effectively construct an efficient knowledge discovery and mining model. Ensemble learning, as one research hot spot, aims to integrate data fusion, data modeling, and data mining into a unified framework. Specifically, ensemble learning firstly extracts a set of features with a variety of transformations. Based on these learned features, multiple learning algorithms are utilized to produce weak predictive results. Finally, ensemble learning fuses the informative knowledge from the above results obtained to achieve knowledge discovery and better predictive performance via voting schemes in an adaptive way. In this paper, we review the research progress of the mainstream approaches of ensemble learning and classify them based on different characteristics. In addition, we present challenges and possible research directions for each mainstream approach of ensemble learning, and we also give an extra introduction for the combination of ensemble learning with other machine learning hot spots such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.},

  abstract = {The K-562 leukemia cell line, originally established in our laboratory, has been characterized as an early precursor of the granulocytic series with a block for differentiation. Since K-562 blasts did not differentiate when cultured for 7-8 days in liquid media or 14-16 days in agar-gel an attempt was made to stimulate their potential for spontaneous differentiation by prolonging the time in culture. Inducers of differentiation were not added to the cultures and the cells were studied when they reached the steady state rather than during exponential growth. The cultivation of K-562 cells for 10 to 11 days in media gradually depleted of the essential nutrients needed for cell division induced their differentiation into early precursors of the monocytic, granulocytic, and erythrocytic series. Thus, the peroxidase reaction for hemoglobin demonstrates benzidine-positive material limited to the region of the Golgi apparatus. Analysis of the hemoglobin by isoelectric focusing indicated major bands in the region of embryonic hemoglobin. Most cells (80-90\%) give a strong reaction for α-naphthyl acetate esterase typical of monocytes and as many as 30 to 40\% of the cells have abundant red cytoplasmic granules of naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase characteristic of granulocytic precursors. Myeloperoxidase activity was found in 5 to 10\% of the cells. Polyploid cells (5-8\%) and early myelomonocytic precursors have PAS-positive material, were stained with Sudan black, and possessed abundant acid phosphatase. The data support the conclusion that K-562 is, indeed, a multipotential leukemia cell line of human origin.},

The lyophilized γ-globulin preparation, termed leukoglobulin, contained about 50\% immune IgG and suppressed the proliferation of heterotransplanted leukemia and lymphoma cells of human origin. The main aims of this study were to evaluate the potential therapeutic value of leukoglobulin and to determine its toxicity in humans with terminal leukemia and patients whose disease was unresponsive to current therapy. Two patients with CML, one with AMML, four with All, and one with AML were treated once a week for up to 5 weeks with leukoglobulin intravenously at doses ranging from 2 to 29 mg/kg. Leukoglobulin was well tolerated with minimal adverse effects and produced an initial mobilization of blasts from the bone marrow, spleen, and other organs with a parallel increase in the number of blasts in the systemic circulation. Subsequent injections of leukoglobulin led to a sharp decrease and the eventual eradication of blasts from the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Except in patients with CML, immature cells other than blasts also markedly diminished. The results of the clinical trials indicated a synergism with or potentiation of most chemotherapeutic agents used. Two possible uses for a combination of leukoglobulin and antileukemic drugs are indicated by the results were report here; drug-antibody synergism for cases showing no response to chemotherapy alone or leukoglobulin given immediately after chemotherapy is administered to eliminate residual leukemia cells. Alternatively, leukoglobulin can be given as a single therapeutic agent during the induction or maintenance phases of treatment to patients with leukemia resistant to other therapeutic combinations.},

  abstract = {Background Nearly thirty years ago, it was first shown that malignant transformation with single oncogene necessarily requires the immortal state of the cell. From that time this thesis for the cells of human origin was not disproved. The basic point which we want to focus on by this short communication is the correct interpretation of the results obtained on the widely used human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Results Intensive literature analysis revealed an increasing number of recent studies discovering new oncogenes with non-overlapping functions. Since the 1970s, dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer. Cultured cell lines are often used as model systems in these experiments. In some investigations the results obtained on such cells are interpreted by the authors as a malignant transformation of normal animal or even normal human cells (as for example with HEK293 cells). However, when a cell line gains the ability to undergo continuous cell division, the cells are not normal any more, they are immortalized cells. Nevertheless, the authors consider these cells as normal human ones, what is basically incorrect. Moreover, it was early demonstrated that the widely used human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells have a relationship to neurons. Conclusions Thus, the experiments with established cell lines reinforce the notion that immortality is an essential requirement for malignant transformation that cooperates with other oncogenic changes to program the neoplastic state and substances under such investigation should be interpreted as factors which do not malignantly transform normal cells alone, but possess the ability to enhance the tumorigenic potential of already immortalized cells.},
