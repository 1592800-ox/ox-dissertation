\chapter{Full List of Features Invested}
\label{appendix:features}

For individual feature such as tm-pbs, $\checkmark$ indicates that the feature was used in the final model and $\times$ indicates that the feature was not used in the final model. At the same time, for a group of features, if at least one feature was used in the final model, a $\circ$ is placed in the last column.
