\section{Benchmarking}

% TODO: add references to the section and appendix after including the results
Although both PRIDICT and DeepPrime uses different features, as seen in the ensemble section as well as appendix, for a more direct comparison of the architecture, both models were retrained using the features selected from this study. Since all models use the same number of features, the data is hot swapped between the models, and can thus be used on other feature sets if desired in the future.
